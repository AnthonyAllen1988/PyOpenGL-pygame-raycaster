# PyOpenGL-pygame-raycaster
This is a raycaster built in python using PyOpenGL and pygame

This is based off the raycast engine made by 3D Sage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA

Pygame was used as OpenGL.GLUT wasn't working and everything I tried to get it to work was fruitless

Packages required:
PyOpenGL https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL/
pygame https://www.pygame.org/
